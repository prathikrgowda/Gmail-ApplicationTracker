# 📬 Gmail Job Application Auto‑Labeler with OpenAI & Google Apps Script

An AI-powered Gmail automation tool that reads your job-related emails, classifies them using GPT-4o, labels them in Gmail, extracts metadata (like position, date, and company), and logs everything into Google Drive CSVs — all running every 30 minutes.
